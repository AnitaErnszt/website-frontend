        <p>My name is Anita and I'm a junior programmer living in London.</p>
        <p>I have started programming a few months ago and it's been an incredible journey so far.
        Every day I learn something new and I really enjoy that I can do more and more.
        I've created this website with the purpose of showing off my amazing new skills <span role="img" aria-label="emoji">ðŸ˜Š</span>
        This website is changing day-by-day as I learn more.</p>

        <p>Please look around and let me know if you have any questions.</p>
        <p>Thank you, Anita</p>
